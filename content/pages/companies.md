# In Your Class

A combination of facebook and Blackboard.  The company was founded by
three Ukrainian immigrants in 2009 while they were students at City
College. The app is used by 40,000 CUNY Students. Stanford's
development office uses it to handle communications with its parent 
association.  The company has just secured A round funding of $800 thousand 
dollars.  Ari Xehlo, a co-founder, says "We are looking to hire 
CUNY students who are hungry to learn and do their best work."

# The International Black Doctoral Network

The Black Doctoral Network (BDN) is a multidisciplinary clearinghouse
for black and Latino scholars and professionals in the Social
Sciences, STEM, and Humanities. BDN carves out for itself an empowered
position in black and Latino communities to mitigate the achievement
gap among persons at all education levels, challenge persistent
negative stereotypes of black and Latino achievement, answer the call
for diversity in university and professional organizations, and bridge
the gap between theory and practices informing extant understandings
of disparate outcomes along the lines of race and ethnicity.
