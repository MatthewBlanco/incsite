# Starter Jobs

A mobile app for distributing and crowd sourcing jobs advertised on
NYC streets.  This app is aimed at marginal communities, particularly
ex-prisoners.

# Flushing Chamber of Commerce

An important part of the economy of Flushing is restaurants. Flushing
was primarily settled by Taiwanese and other Mandarin speaking Chinese
immigrants.  This is the cuisine for which the neighborhood is most
well known.  There are additional communities of Irish, Greek,
Russian, and Italian communities, as well as communities of Indians,
Sri Lankans, Malaysians, and Hispanics, mostly Colombians and
Salvadorans.  We are compiling a map of the restaurants
of these various ethnic groups.

# STEM+C

The NSF has funded schools to create projects that a computational
element to science labs.  This is an ideal project for IPython and/or
project Jupyter. See [nsf<sub>grant</sub>](http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2015/nsf15537/nsf15537.htm). The STEM+C Partnerships program seeks
to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science,
technology, engineering, mathematics (STEM), and computing by K-12
students and teachers, through research on, and development of,
courses, curriculum, course materials, pedagogies, instructional
strategies, or models that innovatively integrate computing into one
or more STEM disciplines, or integrate STEM content into the teaching
and learning of computing. In addition, STEM+C seeks to build capacity
in K-12 computing education with foundational research and focused
teacher preparation. Projects in the STEM+C Partnerships program
should build on research in STEM education and prior research and
development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical
justification for proposed projects. Pre-service and in-service
teachers who participate in STEM+C projects are expected to enhance
their understanding and teaching of STEM and computing content,
practices, and skills.
