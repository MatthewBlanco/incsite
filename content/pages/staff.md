I am a GC Digital Fellow and sixth year PhD student in Criminal
Justice at the CUNY Graduate Center. My dissertation is a
Quasi-experimental evaluation of a public health centered
anti-violence programs. I recently served as a CUNY John Jay
Presidential Fellow where I work on the Misdemeanor Justice
Project. At John Jay I am a member of the
Punishment-2-Public-Health-Academy and the Social Network Research
Group (SNRG-NYC). . I mentor for the College Initiative, a project
which helps people returning from prison access higher
education. Additionally, I serve on the Men's Advisory Board for the
Prison Visiting Project of Corrections Association of New York as well
as the Research Advisory Board of NY Public Library. I am a member of
(and have given at least one presentation at) the meetup groups
NYC-D3-JS, NYC Python and Emacsnyc. At the Queens College incubator,
my principal focus is on the Starter Jobs project and I hope to
contribute to the STEM+C and Cuisine Map of Flushing as well.
